# Project 1
This was a project in C++ to create a program using Linked Lists or Arrays to create a program that took 14 days of Blood sugar levels. 

Used the following links for some pieces of my code:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/header-files-cpp?view=vs-2019

I also was assisted by Jordan P with creation of portions (arrays mainly).
This does not have the day to day/week to week delta values and calculations inluded. 
This was for the COSC 2030 fall 2018 Class at the University of Wyoming taught by Dr. Mike Borowczak.
